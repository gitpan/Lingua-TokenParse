  the Lingua::TokenParse module.  The others are simply provided for
  convenience.

README - This file.
dict_fetch - Program to grab entries from a dictionary server.
sample0 - The module's SYNOPSIS section.
sample1 - A simple example program.
sample2 - An example program that calls dict_fetch.
set_entry - A handy CGI that I use to assist in populating lexicons.
token_parse - A sample CGI (provided because, let's face it, most
    word people are not computer programmers).
